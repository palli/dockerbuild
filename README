About
=====

Set of scripts made to quickly generate debian/rpm packages from a remote git repo.


Usage
=====

The following will build debian packages for all platforms granted that
remote repository exists and it has a debian/ directory

    ./bin/packager <remote_git_repo>


All artifacts will be saved in /var/cache/packages/ by default. To upload
these to a remote debian repository, run the following:

    ./bin/update_debian_repository <remote_debian_repo>
